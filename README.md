New Tab Homepage
================
Loads your homepage when you open a new tab.

Details
-------
You can customise this extension to load the new tab in the background by typing "about:config" into the location bar, finding the "newtabhomepage.selectnewtab" preference and double-clicking it. By default, the extension follows Firefox's behaviour and opens new tabs in the foreground. 

Installation
------------
Drag and drop the latest XPI file from the build folder into a Firefox window. Alternatively, you can install the extension from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-homepage/
